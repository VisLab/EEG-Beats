# EEG-Beats
Toolbox to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) in conjunction with EEG

This toolbox extracts heartbeat peaks and interbeat interval measures
from a single channel of EEG that has been recorded by placing an EEG
sensor on the upper portion of the chest. Scripts provide automated
processing for all .set files in a directory tree.
